# Assignment 1 - Simple DB with Hashmap-based Index

This is the first assignmet for Software Development cource Databases.

I need to make a program that can read a binary file and look for a key, then it needs to give a byte offset for when it starts to where it stops.
Then it should give the value to that key.

dict key is db key, dict value is byte offset. 

Then i should with my dict be able to read and write from and from a db 

This project uses two Standard Libraries, `pickle` and `argparse`. So there shouldn't be a need to install anything with pip.  

### How to run the program

Because this project uses argparse you can run the program fairly easly.

In your terminal you can write `python3 simple_db.py -h` to get in terminal interface where i says how you use it.
